WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (red), present (yellow), or future (green).

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event.

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist.
